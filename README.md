Since the report, the number of new cases of COVID-19 has been steadily decreasing, with current levels well below the peak in around early January for most advanced economies. This may be attributed to tighter measures in containment and the rollout of effective vaccines. However, in recent days, an upward surge in new cases can be seen in some countries, reflecting high uncertainty in the evolution of the virus infection despite mass vaccination programs that have been implemented. This surge is especially noticeable for the European Union, and moderately noticeable for the United States and Canada. Canada’s proportion of daily new cases has remained steady as the second lowest amongst the five advanced economies, but the recent surge has elevated its position to third.
