Since the report, the number of new cases of COVID-19 has been steadily decreasing, with current levels well below the peak in around early January for most advanced economies. This may be attributed to tighter measures in containment and the rollout of effective vaccines. However, in recent days, an upward surge in new cases can be seen in some countries, reflecting high uncertainty in the evolution of the virus infection despite mass vaccination programs that have been implemented. This surge is especially noticeable for the European Union, and moderately noticeable for the United States and Canada. Canada’s proportion of daily new cases has remained steady as the second lowest amongst the five advanced economies, but the recent surge has elevated its position to third.

The equity indices that have continued to rise since the report was published include the SP/TSX composite, the S&P500, and the STOXX 50. This reflects the decreasing uncertainty among investors and their expectations of improved growth prospects. These observations are consistent with decrease rates of new COVID-19 cases as seen in Chart 1. Also, as “bond yields continue to be very low for most advanced economies” (Governing Council of the Bank of Canada, 2021, pg. 4) due to low policy rates, it has supported higher demand for investment in equity, thus raising prices in the equity markets. The two indices that have decreased are the SSE composite and the MSCI. The Canadian dollar continues to strengthen against the USD, and the rising CEER indices also indicate an appreciating Canadian dollar against Canada’s major trading partners.
